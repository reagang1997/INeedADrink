# Good Beer Day?

A simple wed application that allows you to view a five day forecast, based on the conditions it will tell you if it is or isn't a good day to enjoy a beer outdoors. On the days that are enjoyable, you can then choose to view local breweries information in your area. 

## User Story

So I can either make a spontaneous trip, or plan ahead which brewery(or breweries) to visit.
